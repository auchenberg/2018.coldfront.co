                    <p>ColdFront is all about the future, but we know some of the talks can be hard to apply to your daily job, so we want to combine an outlooking perspective with tangible hands-on workshops where you can learn about new things, and meet like-minded people to share ideas, perspectives or maybe just have fun!</p>
