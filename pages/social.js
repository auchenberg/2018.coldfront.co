                <p>Copenhagen is the meltingpot for front-end, design, architecture and food. Did you know PHP, C++, Ruby on Rails were invited in Denmark? Ever heard about Arne Jacobsen? Noma? New nordic food? or Bjarke Ingles?</p>

                <p>Come to Copenhagen and experience an international city that's the melting point of software and design. ColdFront will be held in VEGA, one of the leading concert stages in Europe, that's showcasing original 50's design gives the building a unique atmosphere. VEGA's decor with dark wood paneling, mahogany floors, friezes, and the many original details including railings, balustrades and lamps in typical Scandinavian style are the hallmarks of VEGA.</p>
