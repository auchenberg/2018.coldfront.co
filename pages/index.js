        <h2>The front-end role has evolved!</h2>
        <p>ColdFront is a unique two-day international conference for front-end and mobile developers in Copenhagen on November 13-14th 2018. The front-end role has evolved, and building modern interfaces requires you to be present on many platforms regardless of the technology.</p>

        <p>How do you deliver a modern interface that works on any platform?</p>
        <p>At Coldfront 2018, we will take a look at the entire stack by throwing a two day conference for everyone who are passionate about building front-ends and interfaces. So whether you are a iOS, Android, mobile, web, frontender or something in between, ColdFront is the place to be.</p>
        <p>Join us, in the heart of Copenhagen, Denmark with 16 talks by renowned speakers, delicious nordic food and boatloads of social fun and networking.</p>

                <h2>Come to Copenhagen!</h2>
                <p>Copenhagen is the meltingpot for front-end, design, architecture and food. Did you know PHP, C++, Ruby on Rails were invited in Denmark? Ever heard about Arne Jacobsen? Noma? New nordic food? or Bjarke Ingles?</p>
                <p>Yup, all Danish ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡°</p>
                <p>Come to Copenhagen and experience an international city that's the melting point of software and design. ColdFront will be held in VEGA, one of the leading concert stages in Europe, that's showcasing original 50's design gives the building a unique atmosphere. VEGA's decor with dark wood paneling, mahogany floors, friezes, and the many original details including railings, balustrades and lamps in typical Scandinavian style are the hallmarks of VEGA.</p>
