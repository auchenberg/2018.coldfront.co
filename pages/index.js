          <h2>The future of front-end and interfaces</h2>
          <p>ColdFront is a unique front-end conference that spans across the stacks of technologies and focuses on the craft and challenges of delivering modern interfaces and front-ends that works on any platform. </p>
          <p>Building a great interfaces requires a modern front-end that's present on many different platforms using vastly different technologies, and yet our front-end communities are typically isolated by stacks and not challanges.</p>
          
          <p>With ColdFront we are changing that, by throwing a <strong>two day</strong> conference in <strong>Copenhagen</strong> with 16 talks by renowned speakers, delicious nordic food and boatloads of social fun and networking.</p>
